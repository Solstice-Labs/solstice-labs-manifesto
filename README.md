## **🌙 OUR CREED**  
**We reject:**  
☀️ *Daylight hours*  
📅 *"Reasonable deadlines"*  
😴 *Sleep as a concept*  

**We embrace:**  
🌑 *The glow of monitors at 3AM*  
🚀 *Deploying on Fridays (chaos is a ladder)*  
💀 *Git commits titled "fuck it we ball"*

## **⚡ OUR PRINCIPLES**  

### **1. **CODE NEVER SLEEPS**  
> *"If it compiles at dawn, ship it."*  

### **2. **PROD IS OUR TEST ENV**  
> *"Why stage when users love surprises?"*  

### **3. **DOCUMENTATION IS A MYTH**  
> *"Comments lie. The bloodshot eyes of your coworkers don’t."*  

### **4. **WE ARE ALL SRE NOW**  
> *"If you didn’t wake up to a PagerDuty alert, did you even code?"*  

### **5. **THE BORROW CHECKER IS THE ENEMY**  
> *"Rustaceans will be first against the wall when the revolution comes."*  

### **6. **MEMES ARE A VALID TEST STRATEGY**  
> *"If the screenshot gets 5+ reacts in #dev-chat, it’s production-ready."*
